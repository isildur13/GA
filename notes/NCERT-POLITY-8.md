# NCERT-POLITY-8


## Part 1. Indian Constitution and Secularism

---------------------------------
Chapter 1 Indian Constitution
---------------------------------
* Need for Constitution:-

  * Lays out ideals that form basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to live in. (Tells us what the fundamental nature of our society). 
  
  * A country is usually made up of different communities of people who share certain beliefs but may not necessarily agree on all issues. A Constitution helps serve as a set of rules and principles that all persons in a country can agree upon as the basis of the way in which they want the country to be governed. This includes not only the type of government but also an agreement on certain ideals that they all believe the country should uphold.


* *Features of the Indian Constitution*:-

  1. **Federalism** (More than one level of government)
 
      1) Central Government (Can make decisions on certain issues for the nation)
      2) State Government  (Autonomy on certain issues)
      3) Panchayati Raj 

   ***The Constitution contains lists that detail the issues that each tier of govenment can make decisions on.***
   
   ***Under federalism, the states are not merely agents of the federal government but draw their authority from the Constitution as well***

  2. **Parliamentary Form of Government**

     * Representatives are elected by the people.
     * Constitution of India guarantees universal adult suffrage for all citizens.
  
  3. **Separation of Power**

     * Three organs of the State(India):
        1) Legislative (Elected representatives)
        2) Executive (Responsible for implementing laws and running the government)
        3) Judiciary (For Justice)

        ***State vs Government***

          * Government is responsible for administrating and enforcing the laws.
          * State is the political institution that represents a soverign people who occupy the a definite territory.
          * The Government is one part of the State. The State referes to more than just the Government and hence cannot be used interchangeably.

  4. **Fundamental Rights**

      Fundamental Rights, protect citizens against the arbitrary and absolute exercise of power by the State. The Constitution, thus, guarantees the rights of individuals against the State as well as against other individuals.    


  5. **Secularism**
   
      A Secular state is a state which does not officially promote any one religion as the state religion.


---------------------------------
Chapter 2 Secularism
---------------------------------

  **Separation of Religion from the State**
  
  In all of the above examples, members of one religious community either persecute or discriminate against members of other religious communities. 
  
  These acts of discrimination take place more easily when one religion is given official recognition by the State at the expense of other religions.

  To prevent domination of one religion group over others.
  To prevent domination of some members of the same religious groups over other members.
  The state does not enforce any particular religion nor it takes away the religious freedom of individuals.

  The State implements secularism by following 3 ways:-

  1) Distancing itself from the religion (e.g: No official religion of the state)
  2) By allowing certain exeptions (Non interference eg: pugri and helmet)
  3) By interference. (e.g: untouchability, inheritance laws, grants for educational and institutions.)
      * Preventive
      * Supportive

  There is one significant way in which Indian secularism differs from the dominant understanding of secularism as practised in the United States of America. 
  
  This is because unlike the strict separation between religion and the State in American secularism, in Indian secularism the State can intervene in religious affairs

  In Indian secularism, though the State is not strictly separate from religion it does maintain a principled distance vis-à-vis religion. 
  
  This means that any interference in religion by the State has to be based on the ideals laid out in the Constitution



## Part 2. Parliament and the making of Laws

---------------------
Chapter 3 Parliament
---------------------

Parliament (Sansad): **Supreme law making institution**
  1) President
  2) Lok Sabha (House of the People), 545 , presided by the Speaker. 543(Elected) + 2(Nominated)
  3) Rajya Sabha (Council of States), 245, Chaired by Vice President. 


**Rajya Sabha**

  * The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of various states.

  * There are 233 elected members plus 12 members nominated by the President.

Functions of Parliament:

  * ***Selection of the National Government*** 
  * ***Control, Guide and Inform the Government***
  * ***Law Making***
  
Opposition Party and its crucial role in a democracy:-

  * They highlight drawbacks in various policies and programmes of the government and mobilise popular support for their own policies.
  * They Questions the government on its policies and execution.(Keeps the government on it toes..)


---------------------
Chapter 4 Understanding Laws
---------------------

The law is indifferent: ***The most important of these was that all persons in independent India are equal before the law.***

People who think that the law is not fair can approach the court to decide on the issue. The court has the power to modify or cancel laws if it finds that they don’t adhere to the Constitution.

We need to remember that our role as citizens does not end with electing our representatives. Rather, it is then that we begin to use newspapers and the media to carefully chart the work that is being done by our MPs and criticise their actions when we feel it is required


## Part 3. The Judiciary

---------------------
Chapter 5 Judiciary
---------------------

* Judicial System: Enforce the rule of law.

  * Provides mechanisms of courts that a citizen can approach when a law is violated.


* Broad classification of the work done by judiciary:-

  * **Dispute Resolution**
  
    * Between Citizens.
    * Between Citizens and  Government.
    * Between two State Government.
    * Between Center and State Government.
  
  * **Judicial Review**
  
    * Can strike down the laws that may be in violation of the basic structure of the Constitution.

  * **Upholding and Enforcing the Law and Fundamental Rights**

  * **Separation of Powers**: The courts are not under the government and do not act on their behalf.
      
      * For the above separation to work well, it is also crucial that all judges in the High Court as well as the Supreme Court are appointed with very little interference from these other branches of government. Once appointed to this office, it is also very difficult to remove a judge.

  * We have integrated system of Judiciary. Meaning decisions made by higher courts are binding on the lower courts.

  * Another way to understand this integration is through the appellate system that exists in India. This means that a person can appeal to a higher court if they believe that the judgment passed by the lower court is not just.

  * Heirachy of the Courts

    1) **Supreme Courts** (Headed by Chief Justice of India(CJI) )
    2) **High Courts**
    3) **District Courts**

  * Branches of Legal System in India:-

     * **Criminal Law**
        
        * Deals with conduct/acts that the law defines as offences.
        * Begins with FIR.
        * Accused is Jailed and/or Fined if Guilty.

      * **Civil Law**

        * Deals with any harm/injury to the rights of the individuals.
        * Petition has to be filed before the relevant court by the affected party only.
        * Court gives specific release asked for.

   * Public Interest Litigation(**PIL**) 
        
        * Supreme Court devised a mechanism of Public Interest Litigation or PIL to increase access to justice.

        * Allowed any individual/organization to file PIL in High Court/Supreme Court on behalf of those whose rights were being violated.

   * Some important Cases:
